### **A template for writing Uniswap v4 Hooks ðŸ¦„**

[`Use this Template`](https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/v4-template/generate)

1. The example hook [Counter.sol](src/Counter.sol) demonstrates the `beforeSwap()` and `afterSwap()` hooks
2. The test template [Counter.t.sol](test/Counter.t.sol) preconfigures the v4 pool manager, test tokens, and test liquidity.

<summary>Updating to v4-template:latest</summary>

This template is actively maintained -- you can update the v4 dependencies, scripts, and helpers: 
```bash
git remote add template https://github.com/uniswapfoundation/v4-template
git fetch template
git merge template/main <BRANCH> --allow-unrelated-histories
```

### Check Forge Installation
*Ensure that you have correctly installed Foundry (Forge) Stable. You can update Foundry by running:*

```
foundryup
```

> *v4-template* appears to be _incompatible_ with Foundry Nightly. See [foundry announcements](https://book.getfoundry.sh/announcements) to revert back to the stable build



## Set up

*requires [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh)*

```
forge install
forge test
```

<summary><h2>Troubleshooting</h2></summary>



### *Permission Denied*

When installing dependencies with `forge install`, Github may throw a `Permission Denied` error

Typically caused by missing Github SSH keys, and can be resolved by following the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) 

Or [adding the keys to your ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#adding-your-ssh-key-to-the-ssh-agent), if you have already uploaded SSH keys

### Hook deployment failures

Hook deployment failures are caused by incorrect flags or incorrect salt mining

1. Verify the flags are in agreement:
    * `getHookCalls()` returns the correct flags
    * `flags` provided to `HookMiner.find(...)`
2. Verify salt mining is correct:
    * In **forge test**: the *deployer* for: `new Hook{salt: salt}(...)` and `HookMiner.find(deployer, ...)` are the same. This will be `address(this)`. If using `vm.prank`, the deployer will be the pranking address
    * In **forge script**: the deployer must be the CREATE2 Proxy: `0x4e59b44847b379578588920cA78FbF26c0B4956C`
        * If anvil does not have the CREATE2 deployer, your foundry may be out of date. You can update it with `foundryup`

# v4-constant-sum

### **Constant-sum swap on Uniswap v4 ðŸ¦„**

> **This repo is not production ready, and only serves as an example for custom curves on v4**

With [recent changes](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core/pull/404) to v4, Hooks can swap on custom curves!

`v4-constant-sum` implements constant-sum swaps (*x + y = k*), allowing for an exact 1:1 swap everytime

---

## Methodology

2. The hook will hold its own token balances (as liquidity for the constant-sum curve)

3. The `beforeSwap` hook will handle the constant-sum curve:
    1. inbound tokens are taken from the PoolManager
        * this creates a debt, that is paid for by the swapper via the swap router
        * the inbound token is added to the hook's reserves
    2. an *equivalent* number of outbound tokens is sent from the hook to the PoolManager
        * the outbound token is removed from the hook's reserves
        * this creates a credit -- the swap router claims it and sends it to the swapper
